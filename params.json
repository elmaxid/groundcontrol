Service Providers need direct responsibility for monitoring and managing their network, and vendor-lock in for C&C systems is always a problem.\r\n\r\nThis project is about removing vendor lock-in from management interfaces, and giving C&C back to network operators on a simple to use system that is brand and product diverse.\r\n\r\nInitially we want to be able to:\r\n* poll devices\r\n* collect historic data\r\n* mass change configs\r\n* save config backups\r\n* log and timestamp config changes\r\n* ubnt, mikrotik, cambium ePmP support\r\n* group radios by AP MAC\r\n* schedule upgrades / mass-upgrades\r\n\r\nEventually, we'd like to be able to:\r\n* Map subscribers to their APs using google maps (or similar)\r\n* create a well documented API, device template, and theming/branding system\r\n* allow other people to create/submit device templates for linux/windows hosts, routers, switches, etc\r\n* allow custom SNMP OID polling\r\n* custom ssh scripts/agents\r\n* alerting\r\n* tcp based iperf speedtest (single and multi-stream) from device to device\r\n* remote airview (quite possible) on XM/XW series devices\r\n* etc\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
